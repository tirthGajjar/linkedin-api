How To Search for Jobs Using the LinkedIn API
========================================

.. note::
    This guide uses the unofficial `linkedin-api <https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api>`_ Python package. While this package provides convenient access to LinkedIn's API, please note that it is not officially supported by LinkedIn.

Introduction
-----------

Programmatically searching for jobs on LinkedIn can help you build job boards, track opportunities, or automate your job search. In this guide, we'll show you how to use the ``search_jobs()`` method to find and filter job listings.

Prerequisites
------------

Before you begin, you'll need:

* Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system
* The ``linkedin-api`` package installed
* LinkedIn account credentials

Step 1 — Setting Up the LinkedIn Client
----------------------------------

First, let's import the library and create a client instance:

.. code-block:: python

    from linkedin_api import Linkedin

    # Initialize the API client
    api = Linkedin('your-email@example.com', 'your-password')

Step 2 — Performing a Basic Job Search
---------------------------------

Let's start with a simple search for Python developer jobs:

.. code-block:: python

    # Search for Python developer jobs
    jobs = api.search_jobs(
        keywords='Python Developer',
        location_name='San Francisco'
    )

    # Process the results
    for job in jobs:
        print(f"Title: {job['title']}")
        print(f"Company: {job['companyName']}")
        print(f"Location: {job['locationName']}")
        print("---")

Step 3 — Adding Advanced Filters
---------------------------

The API supports several useful filters to narrow down your search:

.. code-block:: python

    # Search with multiple filters
    jobs = api.search_jobs(
        keywords='Data Scientist',
        remote=[2],              # Remote jobs only
        experience=['2', '3'],   # Entry level and Associate
        job_type=['F', 'C'],    # Full-time and Contract
        location_name='London'
    )

Understanding Search Parameters
--------------------------

Here's what each filter does:

* **experience**: Experience level required
    * '1' = Internship
    * '2' = Entry level
    * '3' = Associate
    * '4' = Mid-Senior
    * '5' = Director
    * '6' = Executive

* **remote**: Work location type
    * 1 = On-site
    * 2 = Remote
    * 3 = Hybrid

* **job_type**: Employment type
    * 'F' = Full-time
    * 'P' = Part-time
    * 'C' = Contract
    * 'T' = Temporary
    * 'I' = Internship
    * 'V' = Volunteer

Handling the Results
----------------

Let's look at how to process and analyze the search results:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get detailed job information
    for job in jobs:
        # Extract key information
        job_id = job['entityUrn'].split(':')[-1]
        
        # Get full job details
        details = api.get_job(job_id)
        
        print(f"Title: {details['title']}")
        print(f"Company: {details['companyName']}")
        print(f"Description: {details['description']}")
        print(f"Listed: {details['listedAt']}")
        print("---")

Troubleshooting Common Issues
-------------------------

Here are some common issues you might encounter:

* **No Results**: Try broadening your search terms or removing some filters
* **Rate Limiting**: LinkedIn limits how many searches you can perform
* **Missing Fields**: Some job listings might not include all fields

Best Practices and Tips
--------------------

1. **Optimize Your Search Terms**:

   .. code-block:: python

       # Use multiple related keywords
       jobs = api.search_jobs(
           keywords='(Python OR Django) AND (Backend OR "Back End")'
       )

2. **Handle Pagination**:

   .. code-block:: python

       # Get more results using offset
       all_jobs = []
       offset = 0
       while True:
           jobs = api.search_jobs(keywords='Developer', offset=offset)
           if not jobs:
               break
           all_jobs.extend(jobs)
           offset += len(jobs)

3. **Cache Results**: Save job data locally to avoid repeated API calls

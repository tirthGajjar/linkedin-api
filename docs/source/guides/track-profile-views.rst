How To Track Profile Views Using the LinkedIn API
===========================================

.. note::
    This guide uses the unofficial `linkedin-api <https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api>`_ Python package. While this package provides convenient access to LinkedIn's API, please note that it is not officially supported by LinkedIn.

Introduction
-----------

Monitoring who views your LinkedIn profile can provide valuable insights into your network visibility and the effectiveness of your profile optimization. In this guide, we'll show you how to use the ``get_current_profile_views()`` method to track your profile's visibility.

Prerequisites
------------

Before you begin, you'll need:

* Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system
* The ``linkedin-api`` package installed
* LinkedIn account credentials
* A LinkedIn account with view tracking enabled

Step 1 — Setting Up the LinkedIn Client
----------------------------------

First, let's import the library and create a client instance:

.. code-block:: python

    from linkedin_api import Linkedin

    # Initialize the API client
    api = Linkedin('your-email@example.com', 'your-password')

Step 2 — Getting Current View Count
-----------------------------

Let's fetch the current number of profile views:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get the current view count
    views = api.get_current_profile_views()
    print(f"Your profile was viewed {views} times")

Step 3 — Tracking Views Over Time
---------------------------

To monitor trends, you might want to track views over time:

.. code-block:: python

    import datetime
    import json
    import time

    def track_views_over_time(api, interval_hours=24):
        while True:
            views = api.get_current_profile_views()
            timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()
            
            # Save to a file
            with open('profile_views.json', 'a') as f:
                json.dump({
                    'timestamp': timestamp,
                    'views': views
                }, f)
                f.write('\n')
            
            print(f"Views at {timestamp}: {views}")
            time.sleep(interval_hours * 3600)  # Wait for specified hours

Understanding Profile Views
----------------------

The view count data includes:

* Total number of profile views
* Views from the last 90 days
* Both anonymous and identified viewers
* Views from all connection levels

Analyzing View Data
---------------

Here's how to analyze your view data:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    
    # Read stored view data
    def analyze_views():
        views_data = []
        with open('profile_views.json', 'r') as f:
            for line in f:
                views_data.append(json.loads(line))
        
        df = pd.DataFrame(views_data)
        df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
        
        # Calculate daily views
        daily_views = df.set_index('timestamp').resample('D')['views'].mean()
        print("Daily average views:", daily_views.mean())
        
        return daily_views

Troubleshooting Common Issues
-------------------------

Here are some common issues you might encounter:

* **Zero Views**: Check if profile view tracking is enabled
* **Rate Limiting**: LinkedIn limits how often you can fetch view data
* **Access Issues**: Premium features might affect available data
* **Inconsistent Numbers**: View counts might have slight delays

Best Practices and Tips
--------------------

1. **Regular Monitoring**:

   .. code-block:: python

       def monitor_views_with_alerts(threshold=10):
           previous_views = api.get_current_profile_views()
           time.sleep(3600)  # Wait an hour
           
           current_views = api.get_current_profile_views()
           new_views = current_views - previous_views
           
           if new_views > threshold:
               print(f"Alert: {new_views} new profile views in the last hour!")

2. **Data Storage**:

   .. code-block:: python

       def save_view_history(views_data):
           with open('view_history.json', 'w') as f:
               json.dump({
                   'date': datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
                   'views': views_data,
                   'notes': 'Profile views after LinkedIn post'
               }, f, indent=2)

3. **Profile Optimization**:
   * Monitor views after profile updates
   * Track which activities increase views
   * Compare views with connection growth
